            The main aspect of the K9 Angels Rescue redesign was to allow users to navigate more efficiently and effectively. Before, an overwhelming breach of infromation and loss of navigation left the user feeling lost. With user research, proto-persona, and testing, our team was able to pin-point the users main goal in adopting and donating to this life changing organization.

            The peak research lead us to see that a focus on communication and connection with the user was pivetal. Easy structure in donations were also important considering the average user wants a pain free, secure way to support. Adoptions were also key in making sure we had a way for the user to feel connected and able to set up meeting these potential family members.

            Ideating the given website allowed us to focus on what each K9 Angels Rescue patron was feeling and needing. Our team took an approach of shining the light on the wonderful feeling of adoption and support in saving the lives of these loyal dogs. Think about the feeling of a puppy in your arms. Think about the energy. Our goal was the capture that in color, text, and appearance.
